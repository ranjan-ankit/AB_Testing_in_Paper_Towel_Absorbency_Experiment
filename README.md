# AB_Testing_in_Paper_Towel_Absorbency_Experiment

●	Collaborated with a team to design a balanced complete factorial experiment with 2 factors to observe the absorbency of paper towels of different brands on 2 different types of solutions.

●	Examined model's assumptions, need for transformation, performed analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SAS. 

●	Determined which brand is better based on price and absorbency of a critical solution and accomplished savings per year of $51/year
